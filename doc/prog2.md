The "poor man" PIC programmer
=============================

So, after all I started this project to provide tools for PIC-programming to a friend of mine, but
I regained interest in PICs me too, so I wanted to provide him a PIC programmer while keeping my
old one for me.

I decided to design a new programmer, provide him some transistors and let him have fun on the breadboard.

In this programmer there is no VCC control (because it is not even supported by pickle) while we still have
the VPP control.

You find the schematic below. I'm going to try to explain it as much easily as I can..
